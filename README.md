# GRAD-E1489: Algorithmic Game Theory and Governance

## Matching Algorithm

This repository contains a small Python project implementing the Gale–Shapley Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm using a synthetic dataset of students and universities.

The goal of this toy model is to illustrate the core properties of matching and applicant-optimality, and the difference between proposer and receiver optimal matchings. 

The case is based on a World of Education example from preference lists involving two agents: students and universities.

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini were consulted for coding and LaTeX formatting support. Final answers and submissions are my own.
